## Goal

### Bootstrap

There is a bootstrap compiler. This bootstrap compiler uses a generic SSA backend, which is
implemented with an interpreter.

### Self-Host

Once the bootstrap compiler is powerful enough (see [todo_mvp.md]), it is rewritten in itself.

### Backend Injection

The rewrite does not include its own interpreter; instead, it inherits the interpreter as a backend implementation
injected from the bootstrap compiler. This lets the injected backend offer one additional piece of functionality:
function pointer values generated by the interpreter backend are plain function pointers from the perspective of the
rewrite, as it is running on the same interpreter.

### Macros

Since the rewrite can now compiler code to function pointers, it can start loading functionality from macro code back
into itself.

Since the rewrite shares a syntax and semantics with the bootstrap language it is written in, its declarations can be
reused for user code; the compiler is a library from the start.

### LLVM

Since the rewrite shares a language with the bootstrap compiler, it can compile itself. When done so with an LLVM
backend, a fast macro compiler is produced.
